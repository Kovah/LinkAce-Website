title: About LinkAce
---

LinkAce is a bookmark manager like Shaarli and other similar tools.  
I built this tool to have something that fits my personal needs which other bookmark managers couldn't solve,
even if most features are almost the same. I used Shaarli for a while but I never really felt very comfortable
with it.

The primary intention of the application is to provide a solid solution to archive links and organize them. Those links
may be added from the web application, the bookmarklet or a third-party application via the API.

## Highlights

* Bookmark links with automatic title and description generation.
* Automated, regular link checks to inform you when a saved link goes offline or is moved to another location.
* Automated backups of your links via the [Waybackmachine](https://archive.org/web/web.php). All saved links are sent
    to the Waybackmachine which then stores a copy of the site for you.
* Private or public links. You decide, which saved links are private or which are accessible to the public.

## Other LinkAce features

* Organize bookmarks in lists and tags
* A bookmarklet to quickly save links from any browser
* Add notes to links to add thoughts
* Advanced search for your bookmarks
* Import existing bookmarks from HTML exports (other methods planned)
* Implemented support for complete database and app backups to Amazon AWS S3

## A note on Support

LinkAce is a private side-project mainly developed for *myself*. Therefore I cannot guarantee that the app will work 
without any problems, and I may not answer support requests. **I do not offer any paid customization or support.**

If you need an app with extensive support please consider using another solution.

If you need help or want to report a bug within the application, please open a new [issue](https://github.com/Kovah/LinkAce/issues)
and describe:

* which version you are using,
* what your exact problem is,
* and what you already did to solve the problem.
