title: Support for LinkAce
---

I built LinkAce to solve my problem, and I now offer my solution and code to your without charging anything. Thus I won't offer any free personal support, customization or installation help. If you need help please visit the [community forum]({{< relref path="community.md" >}}) and post your issue there.

{{< alert type="success" >}}

If you need prioritized support you can **become a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Kovah)** 
or **[Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Kovah)**. ⭐️

## In case you need help

Nothing goes exactly as planned. There can be small, hidden problems with LinkAce, or the app is not entirely compatible with your system.

Before posting a new help requests to the Github repository or in the community, please take a look at the [documentation](/docs/v1).


### Posting bug reports

The Github repository is intended to track the development status **and not for support requests!** If you need help without knowing that there is a specific issue with LinkAce itself, please use the [community channels]({{< relref path="community.md" >}})  instead.

If you want to report a bug within the application, please open a new [issue]({{< param "Github" >}}) and describe:

* which version you are using,
* what your exact problem is,
* and what you already did to solve the problem.
