# Change the timezone of the core application here. It does not affect the timezone set in the user settings but changes how LinkAce saves dates and times in the database. Be very careful when using this setting as it can have unintended site effects! There won't be any support for broken applications due to a changed timezone.

## You probably do not want to change any values below. Only continue if you know what you are doing.
## If you are using Redis, you may switch SESSION_DRIVER and CACHE_DRIVER to "redis" or "memcache" to improve performance.
SESSION_DRIVER=file
LOG_CHANNEL=stack
BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
CACHE_DRIVER=file
QUEUE_DRIVER=database


## Using Redis sockets
# If you want to use Redis via a Unix socket, you can remove the hash before the following lines, but remove one before
# the "CACHE_DRIVER" line above. Also, set a proper path to your Redis socket.
CACHE_DRIVER=redis-socket
SESSION_CONNECTION=redis-socket
REDIS_SCHEME=unix
REDIS_PATH=/path/to/redis.sock
```
