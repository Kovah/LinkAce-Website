type: docs

LinkAce itself does not require a high-performance server to run at. Indeed there is just this PHP app that needs access
to a database. However, your environment must fulfill the following requirements to run properly.

There will be **no** support for environments which do not meet the requirements!


## Requirements for Docker

* Shell access to your server
* Docker version 19 or greater
* docker-compose is recommended for the setup, must support compose version 2


## Requirements for setup without Docker

Please see the corresponding [wiki page](/docs/v1/setup/setup-without-docker) for details.


## Continue with the setup

If you are confident that your environment meets the requirements, continue with the setup:

* [Setup with Docker](/docs/v1/setup/setup)
* [Setup without Docker](/docs/v1/setup/setup-without-docker)
