Tags are used to quickly add several labels to a link to categorize it. Usually this is done to add further 
specification of the category for the link. Tags can be added through the menu or directly in the link add form.

## Tag Overview

## Tag Details

The tag detail page is mostly available to give a quick overview on the links added for a particular tag, as an 
alternative for the advanced search.

## Adding Tags

Tags can be added through the menu or directly in the link add form. If added by using the dedicated form accessible
from the menu you have an additional option for making a tag private. It will then be displayed only to you.
 
Please notice that tags cannot contain commas.
